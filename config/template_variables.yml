  ipsec_note: <li>Use the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html">IPsec add-on</a> to encrypt IP data traffic within your deployment.</li>
  isolation_segments_create: After you install the Isolation Segment tile, you must register it with Cloud Controller. If you only install the Isolation Segment tile without registering the isolation segment it creates, Cloud Controller does not detect the isolation segment and cannot place apps on it.
  isolation_segments_intro: To enable isolation segments, an operator must install the Isolation Segment tile by performing the procedures in [Installing Isolation Segment](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-12/customizing/installing-pcf-is.html). Installing the tile creates a single isolation segment.
  isolation_segments_note: <p class="note"><strong>Note<span>:</span></strong> The isolation segment name used in the cf CLI command must match the value specified in the <strong>Segment name</strong> field of the Isolation Segment tile. If the names do not match, Ops Manager fails to place apps in the isolation segment when apps are started or restarted in the space assigned to the isolation segment.</p>
  isolation_segments_smoke_tests: <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you run smoke tests as a post-deploy errand in the Isolation Segment tile, the smoke tests check if your isolation segment is registered in the CCDB. If the isolation segment is not registered, the smoke tests register it in the CCDB. This eliminates the need to manually register an isolation segment with <code>cf create-isolation-segment</code>. For more information, see <a href="../operating/installing-pcf-is.html#smoke-tests">Smoke Tests</a> in <em>Installing Isolation Segment</em>.</p>
  keepalive: For more information, see [Gorouter Back End Keep-Alive Connections](../adminguide/routing-keepalive.html).
  keepalive_router: An operator can enable the feature by entering a non-zero value for the **Keep-alive connections for the Gorouter** field in the **Networking** pane of the TAS for VMs tile.
